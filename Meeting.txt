Three friends gathered at one house to before going into the City.
The friends, Johnny, Mia and Luka, climbed into the same car with Johnny needing the front passenger seat since he was a large man.
Mia and Luka were fine in any seat since they had plenty of leg space.
Once everyone was buckled up into the car they drove off and went into the city.
