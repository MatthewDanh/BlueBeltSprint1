The kids were loud. 
They were way too loud for Jerry, especially since this was a four-hour flight. 
The parents didn't seem to be able, or simply didn't want, to control them. 
They were yelling and fighting among themselves and it was impossible for any of the passengers to concentrate or rest. 
He thought about politely tapping on the parents' shoulders and asking them to try and get their kids under a bit more control, but before he did he came up with a better idea. 
Sure, it was a bit sinister, and he'd probably end p in a lot of trouble, but he really didn't care at that point.

He dropped the ball. 
While most people would think that this was a metaphor of some type, in Joe's case it was absolutely literal. 
He had hopes of reaching the Major League and that dream was now it great jeopardy. 
All because he had dropped the ball.

He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. 
Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate. He couldn't be sure. 
Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it was a long time. 
Much too long.

Trees. 
It was something about the trees. 
The way they swayed with the wind in unison. 
The way they shaded the area around them. 
The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, The trees were making a statement that I just couldn't understand.

He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. 
His heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint. 
"It wasn't a gunshot, it wasn't a gunshot," he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint.
