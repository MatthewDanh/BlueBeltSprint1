Before going home, the friends decided to go to an arcade.
Being competitive they each played the game 3 times to see who could get the highest score.
In order to be consistent, one of them decided to also take the sum of all of the scores and use that for a different competition.
Walking around the arcade, they all had some annoying thing stuck to them.
Luka, unfortunately got a drink spilled on them as they were leaving the arcade.
Mia had stepped into some mud just outside the arcade with being very annoyed.
Johnny unfortunately lost his football after leaving the arcade.
Leaving the city and returning home, the friends split up after saying their goodbyes.
