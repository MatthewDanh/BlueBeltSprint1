Once in the city, the friends decided that it was a good time to go and eat some lunch.
During lunch, Luka spilled some of their drink onto their sneakers. 
Having to clean it up before they left a stain, Luka accidentally stepped on Johnny's boots.
Fortunately it was not Mia's or Ernesto's since they were both wearing sandalls and would have hurt a lot.
